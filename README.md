## oidc-prototype (frontend service)

### Running Keycloak Server

Before running frontend and backend service, you must raise up *Keycloak Server*.

It's really simple to do by following Docker command:

```
docker run 
  -p 8443:8443 \
  -p 9000:9000 \
  -e KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin \
  -e KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=change_me \
  -e KC_HTTPS_CERTIFICATE_FILE=/opt/keycloak/conf/server.crt \
  -e KC_HTTPS_CERTIFICATE_KEY_FILE=/opt/keycloak/conf/server.key \
  -v C:/<path_to_backend_project>/ssl/server.crt:/opt/keycloak/conf/server.crt \
  -v C:/<path_to_backend_project>/ssl/server.key:/opt/keycloak/conf/server.key \
  quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:26.1.2 \
  start \
  --hostname=localhost
```

It will run your Keycloak Server on address: `https://localhost:8443`
Path to Admin Console: `https://localhost:8443/admin/master/console/`
Credentials for Admin Console:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `change_me`

This instance of Keycloak Server is run in production mode with enabled HTTPS.

After first starting up Keycloak Server you will be able to configure it Admin Console and save changes by commiting changed container as image by command:

```
docker commit <CONTAINER_ID> <IMAGE_NAME>:<IMAGE_TAG>
```

You can use this image instead of `quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:26.1.2` and use flag `--optimized`.

### Adjusting Keycloak Server

It may be your time, just remember it and pay attention that access token lifespan must be less than session idle time.

*Test case*

0) Go to "Protcted Page".

1) Login in prototype from Frontend side.

2) Copy access token from cookies into some text file.

3) Wait for <Access Token Lifespan>.

4) Refresh page "Protected Page".

5) Copy access token from cookies AGAIN into some text file.

6) Compare it with previous token: they must be different.

8) Refresh page "Protected Page". You must be redirected into Keycloak Login Page.

```
npm ci
```

#### 2. Generate self-signed certificates

*ATTENTION*: If you already have certificate and key, you may go to step 3.

<TBA>

#### 3. Create folder "ssl" in root of the project

#### 4. Put generated certificate and key into the folder "ssl"

#### 5. Run frontend

```
npm run dev
```
